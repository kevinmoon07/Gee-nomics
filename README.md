# Gee-nomics
Program that searches a .txt file containing the DNA of an organism for a user-specified DNA string sequence. The program receives a DNA string input from the user and searches the organismâ€™s DNA to return the starting position(s) and number of either exact matches or matches differing by at most one character. In addition to the DNA string input, a similarity threshold can be specified by the user to return the name and similarity percentage of closely matching DNA sequences.
